# AppAngularNiv2WithTabulator

## Functionalities

Based on the data retrieved from a back-end API, the desired functionality is to display the list of employees and associated information in a table with:

    - A pagination component at the tabulator-footer to indicate a series of content exists across multiple pages and to easily navigate (10 items is the default number 10 items per page).

    - An ability to sort table data by clicking on column headers (on all columns).

    - A filtering component (filter across all data)

    - An ability to delete items from the table component (only at the Front-end level) by clicking with the right cursor on any row and choose the delete option from the the menu shown below.

    - An Add items option (only at the Front-end level) by filling a form after choosing the add optionfrom the same menu shown in the previous functionnality.
